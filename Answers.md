1. What problem does the context API help solve?
- lets us share data all across the app
1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
- actions show you what you are doing and where you can fetch/post data. reducers set initial state and the start, success, and failure. Store has the whole state of the app.
1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
- component state is stored locally but application state is the state of the whole app. 
1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
- Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
- Redcuers because it simplified some struggles I was having.
